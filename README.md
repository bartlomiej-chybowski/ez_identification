# Improvement of multi-feature SVM model for epileptic foci localisation

---

Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent and impairing neurological disorders[2]. The
main and most common manifestation of epilepsy is an unexpected surge of electrical ac-
tivity in the brain affecting its functions. Epilepsy seisures can be managed with drugs,
however, significant number of cases are drug-resistant[3]. In such situations surgical
treatment might be an option. Successful resection of the epileptogenic region requires
precise localisation. Novel solution proposed by Cimbalnik et al.[1] uses Support Vec-
tor Machine model on combination of univariate and bivariate intracranial EEG features
recorded between seizures for accurate epileptic foci localisation.

The aim of this project is to review approach of Cimbalnik and colleagues, analyse available data 
and propose improvements to the existing model. We hypothesise, that improved feature selection 
with appropriate model will lead to significantly better results (p<0.05) in terms of sensitivity 
and specificity.
